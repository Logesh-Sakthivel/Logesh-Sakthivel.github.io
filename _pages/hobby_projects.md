## FinLyser

FinLyser is a mobile APP which is used to Track your expenses, lends, borrows, investments.

You could add your lends, borrows, expenses and investments in this App. Also, add the budget plans.

The Current version of the App only supports the Expenses and Investments visualization. User can visualize the Expenses and Investments over a period of time.
{: .notice--primary}

Visualize your Total Expenses and Investments, Year wise expenses and investments, Month wise expenses and investments on the particular year and Day wise expenses and investments on the particular month.

The Main moto for me to develop this APP was user data privacy. The Expense that you add in this app to track is completed resides on your Mobile. (This APP doesn’t requires any Internet connectivity since none of the data leaves your Phone.)

The User needs to create an account to proceed further but the coolest thing about this app is that User doesn’t require to enter their Phone number or email or anything, just Username and Password is good to go. By doing so this app doesn’t gets any of the User info.

The APP isn’t published on the Playstore. I have just build this APP for my personal use so i haven’t taken steps to publish it.
But if you want to explore FinLyser, you can find the APK file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13gtFrFvPbSoaA57_VA24C__0eHz7oS4z/view?usp=sharing), i have uploaded in my drive.

## empty-remover 

This CLI app finds and deletes the empty files in the given directory recursively in all the hierarchies from the given path.

Also, you can list the empty files without deleting them by using the flags to this program.

## deldirrecur

This CLI app finds and deletes the given directory recursively in all the hierarchies from the given path.

The main moto for me to build this app is to delete the __pycache__ directory in my Python Project. This __pycache__ will be created in almost all the directories in the Python project. Based on my project requirement I may have 5 to 7 directory hierarchy levels.

So, when I need to rm that dir its hectic for me. So here I have developed this App to do that. Just I can give the dir name as __pycache__ and the path my Project root path to my app then this magic happens.

## Leave_Me_a_Message

Simple WebApp built using Flet in Python. 

The user could fill the form in the Webapp and once the user submits, my telegram bot sends that information to me in Telegram.

I have done this project to get start with the Flet framework in Python to built the apps.
