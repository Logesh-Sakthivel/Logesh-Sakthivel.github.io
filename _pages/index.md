Hi there,

I'm Logesh Sakthivel, and I work as a Senior Engineer (QA) at VVDN Technologies. I am passionate about Python, Go, Linux, API and expertise in Wireless and IoT domain.

Experience
======

With over four years of experience in automating CLI, GUI, and REST APIs using Python in the Networking and IoT domains, I also bring hands-on expertise in CI/CD pipeline integration using Jenkins. Furthermore, I created a programme that simulates packets so it may communicate with a real device or another simulator.

In my current role, I lead a talented automation team, where I am responsible for strategic planning and prioritizing automation tasks. My goal is to foster innovation and ensure that our projects align with business objectives, driving impactful results. Additionally, I develop and maintain our testing framework by customizing Pytest for TCU board automation testing.

My resume is available [here](/cv/).
